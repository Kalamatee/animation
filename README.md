animation datatype for AROS

this is my wip implementation of a replacement animation.datatype for the AROS operating system.
It is based on the public information about the original gained from the autodocs, and source on aminet.

Planned features: 
support for upto v44 animation.datatype (needs more research)

TODO:
most things ...
use pools for all internal allocations (colormaps/frames/etc?)
